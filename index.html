      <h2>Abstract</h2>

      <p>
        Our paper is driven by the hypothesis that conversations on social media
        usually have a political motive behind them. While this may be helpful
        for conversations about politics, sometimes it affects conversations in
        other topics, like public health for example. Due to the spread of
        Covid-19, many people were sharing their opinions online on how to stay
        safe against the virus and we wanted to verify if these opinions were
        actually politically motivated rather than being just good-natured
        advice.
      </p>

      <p>
        We first extract data from Twitter and perform topic modelling to verify
        that politics and public health are indeed 2 major topics of
        conversation on social media. Then we compare the performance of some of
        the latest unsupervised classifiers for the task of detecting whether a
        tweet is medically relevant or politically motivated. To do this we
        manually annotate a subset of the data we extracted and check if the
        label predicted by the unsupervised classifier matches our annotations.

We extract tweets relevant to the pandemic from publicly available Twitter data and analyse them to understand the change in public emotions over the year along with a detailed analysis of the topics of discussion. We find public health and politics to be the two most dominant topics. Hence, we perform a study where we compare the performance of existing unsupervised classification methods for the task of detecting whether a tweet is medically relevant or politically motivated.",
